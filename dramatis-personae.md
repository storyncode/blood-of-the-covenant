# Radames of Siwal

Radames is a native of Siwal, killed by a harpy at a young age. It appears as though someone spent a considerable amount of time using his corpse as a marionette, henceforth referred to as The Impostor.

So far we have gathered that:
  
  - The Impostor turned away from Radames' original faith, focusing instead upon Anu-akma
  - The Impostor was hardened towards people, potentially even becoming a dictator - eventually resulting in the exile of "Radames"
  - The Impostor's daughter, Farrah (_sp?_), was never included in portraiture - a jealously guarded secret perhaps
  - Farrah has The Impostor's journal, and will not relinquish it unless we clear The Tomb of Family Ella
