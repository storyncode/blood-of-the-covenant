# Radames of Siwal

Radames is a native of Siwal, killed by a harpy at a young age. It appears as though someone spent a considerable amount of time using his corpse as a marionette, henceforth referred to as The Impostor.

So far we have gathered that:
  
  - The Impostor turned away from Radames' original faith, focusing instead upon Anu-akma
  - The Impostor was hardened towards people, potentially even becoming a dictator - eventually resulting in the exile of "Radames"
  - The Impostor's daughter, Farrah (_sp?_), was never included in portraiture - a jealously guarded secret perhaps
  - Farrah has The Impostor's journal, and will not relinquish it unless we clear The Tomb of Family Ella

# Delfy Yovnel

Delfy is a former assassin in the service of the Queen of Night and Magic. However, he and his partner/childhood friend, Selvyn, were tasked with investigating darakhul activity outside of the Shadowroads. Aside from his complete loyalty to the queen that saved his life, Defly doesnâ€™t care much for shadow fey politics.  His apathy had also extended to the rest of his life while working as an assassin. However, watching Selyvn die, traveling with a group for the first time, and, most importantly, flying with Nergal, has given him a fresh outlook on life.
