# The Meal
  
  -Radames got hardened towards people, perhaps became something of a tyrant? Ended up exiled from the city.
  - Flipped religious allegiance to Anu-Akma.
  - Has identical shield in house??
  - Altar was destroyed, but not ritually - perhaps done in anger?
  - Thargad has a lovely meal awaiting him at Khepri's house
  - Daughter was never in portraits
  - Daughter has Radames' journal, which contains secrets of the undead
  - Will have to clear tomb to get said journal
  - Must at some point pursue the harpy
  - Khepri pushing for daughter to go with us into tomb
  - Likely some connection between death of Radames and Labaris to Wosyet and Kauket
  - Onyx crystal to bring back Labaris?
  - Ask about masks in the morning, remember Thargad's special mask
