# The beginning

  - The coins gathered into a humanoid
  - Defeated the humanoid coin monster
  - Darakhul Fever for Denahrek and Delfy
  - Defeated mummies during long rest, still got long rest

# After the long rest

  - Went downstairs, got caught in reversed gravity
  - Killed several ghasts
  - Found a secret passage
  - Followed footsteps in the passage, found teeth marks from a worm of some description? Circular pattern, one mouth, 5 ft tile
  - Discovered a shaft, possibly to ensure ventilation, followed it for a little while, found lights, sent Delfy tumbling down in shock after seeing the lights.
  - Footsteps were avian, could be harpies?
  - Around the vent there are lots of stray feathers
  - North found a feather token, whip - can use action to create a whip, bonus action to attack, bonus action to move, disappears after 1h
  - Brooch of shielding
  - Used to be a nest?
  - North dead ends
  - South there are more worm teeth marks, blood on the walls, dead ends
  - We left the secret passage
  - Went south of the entrance of the secret passage, discovered a room covered in dried blood

# After a quick IRL break

  - Skeletons began to move and shuffle into animation
  - Some of the skeletons are clearly more recent with flesh and viscera still clinging to their bones
  - Denahrek killed two skeletons immediately with vitriolic sphere
  - A few others died, then Katarina cleaned house with turn undead
  - Entered the chamber and discovered the Harpy from Radames' past was in the tomb
  - Immediately began attacking the harpy
  - Several undead are also in the chamber, with pustulent boils distorting their bodies
  - Defeated the harpy and zombies, zombies infected a few people with Iumenta pox

# After another quick IRL break
  
  - Went through a trapdoor beneath the harpy's nest
  - Found a ghoul and the ghoul king
  - Ghoul king wanted us to destroy something to release him
  - Denahrek got a feeling from insight check that helping free the ghoul king would be a bad idea for the world
  - Denahrek attacked the ghoul king and ghoul
  - Ghoul king summoned an air elemental
  - Air elemental fucked up Ro'Arkanin, Katarina avoided getting fucked up
  - Ghoul is a caster, lobs a fireball
  - Thargard got lightning blasted to the face
  - Twice
  - Ro'Arkanin polymorphed himself into a giant ape
  - First kill goes to Denahrek, killing the ghoul caster
  - Almost everyone went down
  - Denahrek and Delfy both ended up with 2 death save fails
  - Katarina gets back up
  - Denahrek is deceased (RIP ðŸ˜­)
  - Delfy goes back down, trying to close the lid of a blue ceramic pot (we think this will trap the Ghoul King properly?)
  - Ghoul King ignores everyone and attacks Ro'Arkanin
  - Monkey down ðŸ˜­
  - Ghoul King misses Ro'Arkanin on the backswing though
  - Radames manages to close the urn on a pedestal with a massive force of effort, and the ghoul king is dragged into the urn as it shuts
  - Denahrek begins to shift into a ghoul, will he turn? Will he not?
  - No he will not
  - Katarina goes down from the backlash of resurrecting Denahrek. He's going to be insufferable after this one.
