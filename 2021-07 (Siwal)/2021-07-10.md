# After the long rest

  - Went downstairs, got caught in reversed gravity
  - Killed several ghasts
  - Found a secret passage
  - Followed footsteps in the passage, found teeth marks from a worm of some description? Circular pattern, one mouth, 5 ft tile
  - Discovered a shaft, possibly to ensure ventilation, followed it for a little while, found lights, sent Delfy tumbling down in shock after seeing the lights.
  - Footsteps were avian, could be harpies?
  - Around the vent there are lots of stray feathers
  - North found a feather token, whip - can use action to create a whip, bonus action to attack, bonus action to move, disappears after 1h
  - Brooch of shielding
  - Used to be a nest?
  - North dead ends
  - South there are more worm teeth marks, blood on the walls, dead ends
