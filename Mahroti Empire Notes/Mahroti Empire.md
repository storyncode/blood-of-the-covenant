Harkesh is capitol
Ozmir Al-Stragul (Dread Sultan, Dragonborn)
Dragons are the true leaders
There's 8 regions
There are a lot of dragonlords (see Garo msg)

Social strata:
  - Jambuka (Jackals, any non-scalies, lowest of the low, workers)
  - Kobaldi (Workers, kobolds duh, they are scaled therefore superior to Jambuka)
  - Sekban (People, lowest rank of dragon kin, not in the military - artisans, millers, scribes, merchants etc)
  - Edjit (Elemental families, heavy troops, are devoted to elemental gods, raised from birth to believe scalies are superior)
  - Akinji (Fighters - light cav, warriors, etc. Land holders, mayors etc. Lower high class)
  - Pimarli (Nobles, generally have close relation with actual dragons, i.e. generationally not far removed, serve the sultan directly as spies, diplomats etc)
  - Urmanli (Scaled Lords, actual dragons - roughly 500 in the empire, only people who can claim the title of Morza)
  - Morza (Great Dragon Lords, again actual dragons, only 9 in the empire - the true power behind the sultan)

History:
6 years ago suffered a naval defeat at the hands of Khyprion and allies.
In retaliation a dragon lord flew over and burnt a city to the ground.
Sultan lost power and was replaced 5 years ago.
Current Sultan is known to be vicious, merciless, and cruel. Generally well liked amongst military.
Conquered Eliria 7 years ago, renamed it to Rumela. Still a lot of resistance there.

Calendar:
  - Based on when the kingdom was founded Mahroti Dragon Ages (current year is: 347 MDA)
  - Have different names for the weekdays but for ease just use the others in the party.

Khyprion:
  - Chamiras is currently occupied by Mahroti. 2 months ago, under cover of fog was stormed by Mahroti empire. Immediately we executed 400 random minotaurs to make a point, enslaved everything else.
    - Aarush Vedula is current leader, she is the one that led the storming of Chamiras.
    - Current orders are to enforce Mahroti rule in the city. Must not expand beyond the city for the time being.
    - Chamiras is being rebuilt as a Mahroti fortress.
  - Kalpostan is a place for pilgrimmage.

Hook:
  - Gaul is being sent to Khyprion to keep an eye on and help Seolin. Either she will succeed in overthrowing the queen or she will destabilise Khyprion. Either is fine.
    - If she has the potential to become a threat to MaEmp then kill her.
    - She's a descendant of the queen, unknown who her father is. Presumably a QConsort.
      - Has a claim
        - Weak at best, but can still be pushed in the current environs of Khyprion
  - Left a day or two after Seolin. 

There may be some bad blood. Good luck!
