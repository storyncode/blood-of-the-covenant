Harkesh is capitol
Ozmir Al-Stragul (Sultan, Dragonborn)
Dragons are the true leaders
There's 8 regions
There are a lot of dragonlords (see Garo msg)

Social strata:
  - Jambuka (Jackals, any non-scalies, lowest of the low, workers)
  - Kobaldi (Workers, kobolds duh, they are scaled therefore superior to Jambuka)
  - Sekban (People, lowest rank of dragon kin, not in the military - artisans, millers, scribes, merchants etc)
  - Edjit (Elemental families, heavy troops, are devoted to elemental gods, raised from birth to believe scalies are superior)
  - Akinji (Fighters - light cav, warriors, etc. Land holders, mayors etc. Lower high class)
  - Pimarli (Nobles, generally have close relation with actual dragons, i.e. generationally not far removed, serve the sultan directly as spies, diplomats etc)
  - Urmanli (Scaled Lords, actual dragons - roughly 500 in the empire, only people who can claim the title of Morza)
  - Morza (Great Dragon Lords, again actual dragons, only 9 in the empire - the true power behind the sultan)
