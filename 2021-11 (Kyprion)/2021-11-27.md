# The Stars Descend

- Star Man / Skull Man / Herald of the Void speaks to us after having an ax and a fire bolt thrown at him. Everyone except gaul gains a level of void tain. Pool is proficiency mod + cha mod.
- Offers to withdraw his "children" if the minotaurs fight to the death. If not... it has an endless source of raw magic at its disposal, and is quite happy to reap destruction upon the land.
- Karipos and Thargad fight valiantly, but in the end Karipos falls to the ground, dead and brutalised.
- The Herald of the Void keeps its word, withdrawing its "children" - the tinu n√∫n. Gaul wretches as it escapes his body, then many other black shapeless masses begin arriving.
- Thargad attempts to keep part of the body. The Herald beckons him to give the body over in whole. Thargad attempts to keep the tiniest bit.
- The Herald of the Void steps back, Thalon laughs.
- The Herald of the Void sends magic missiles at Mariana and Thargad. Thargad dies.
- Thalon explains, after some coercion from Gaul, that the Herald said "Luna is not to be here."
- Nalmisel wishes for Thargad's return.
- Light in the form of Thargad returns whole, no missing horn. He gasps and returns. Charon refused him passage.
